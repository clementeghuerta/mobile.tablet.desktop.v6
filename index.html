After a few weeks of research for each infographics, I wrote down ideas and sketched out possible ways of solving that problem.
I decided to use three different data formats, which I think were used well for the type of data being showed to the reader.
Each project took more than a month to complete and all together the projects tookjust over 3 months.

            Process: conceptualizing—I brainstormed ideas, which might benefit my portfolio, leading towards data visualization. |Research —For this project I used Human Interface Guideline and wrote down many notes.|Ideas— I wrote many thought and then kept the best in order to solve a problem I set for myself, which was to cross analyze 2 companies information.|flow —I then wrote down the flow I would be designing, which I cam back to before finalizing for design.|Style Tile + other things—I then create a sort of brand to go by, which I kept throughout the design and kept to the same color scheme and text size indicated from HIG. I read about Lightning Design System and worked with that in mind as well.|Sketching + grid —Sketching was done after writing down the flow and the grid was created with a sketch, somewhat and then finalized in illustrator.|Designing —I wanted the design to have much white space and a great user experience, so I mad the design clean and easy to follow.|Prototyping —This is a step I am currently on.</p>

            Process<br>
            This project was designed to show-case my design process, which turned out to show that I rely on much of my previous design skills. In this case, my illustration skills are prevelant.I believe that the best way to captivate someone’s eye is through white space because it allows the user to focus on the information at hand, also creating a very valuable user experience.</p>

      <p class="about2">I love UI design, visual design, and graphic design. Some of my greatest inspirations come from great User Interfaces like the one's seen from Facebook and Apple. I love creating infographics and clean designs.<br>

      I am currently a graphic design student at California State East Bay studying graphic design and concentrating on UI Design. Before this, I attended Academy of Art University where I learned many different skills such as how to storyboard, edit video, and illustrate in 2D and 3D.<br>

      I love designing mobile first, using wireframes, researching, using stylescapes, creating user paths, prototyping, and designing responsive web designs (RWD), coding with: HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript(jQuery), and using Zurb Foundation, Bootstrap, and WordPress. Also, I have a passion in creating application (app) designs, and I am currently studying Human Interface Guidelines (GUI), Material Design and Lightning Design System.<br>

      Lastly, I have great visual, written, and verbal communication skills. I am very detail-oriented, resourceful, and well-organized. And I work great in self-direction and am also a great team player. And, I have a great love for typography.
